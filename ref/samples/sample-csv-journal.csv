Combine the food with the other features of the season: sunshine, green-grass-barefoot picnics, ultimate frisbee matches, running and playing with a dog, etc, and it's pretty much perfection. ♥️

Interesting ice cream. New age flavors like: 
• Strawberry honey balsamic with black pepper
• Olive Oil
• IPA ice cream. Seriously. Tasted like a frozen IPA. 

This is the blondie with their salted caramel ice cream. They make all their ice cream with butterfat and it is pretty delicious.

We had a great time in New York sampling the sights, sounds, and tastes of the ""city that never sleeps."" Lovely, lovely, lovely.
